## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

The code was written using the Anaconda distribution of Python and should run without issues using Python 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

Data from Stack Overflow from the year 2019 was used to help answer:

1. What characteristics, if any, distinguish Data Scientists/Machine Learning Specialists from other people
 that frequent StackOverflow
2. What type(s) of technologies do Data Scientists/Machine Learning Specialists use?
3. Can we identify if someone classifies themselves as a Data Scientists/Machine Learning Specialists based 
on a subset of answers from the Stack Overflow survey?

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There are three notebooks that showcase the worked related to the questions above.  Each of the notebooks are 
exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title. Markdown cells 
were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/).

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

Credit must be given to Stack Overflow for the data.  You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive 
information [here](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey).  Credit should also be given to Udacity for creating 
the [Data Science](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-scientist-nanodegree--nd025) Nanodegree that this project is 
part of.
